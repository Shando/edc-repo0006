24/5/01 - Added key to reset CPC (F5). First attempt at redirecting CAS READ.
          Added SVGA mode and switchable CPC model (464 or 664). Started GUI.
1/6/01  - GUI now usable. Just discovered 464 doesn't boot anymore - I've
          broken something somewhere...
          No luck with CAS READ yet, but I will get it working...
26/6/01 - Started NEC FDC emulation.
27/6/01 - I can't understand the FDC...
8/7/01  - Tried direct drive support (redirecting CPC FDC to PC FDC), not
          working. Added joystick support (through arrow keys) and some more
          GUI options.
