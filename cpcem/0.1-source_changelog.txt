2/4/01  - Started work on the emulator, using MZ80. Doesn't work.
6/4/01  - Stopped writing to Gate Array.
10/5/01 - Got it to work!
          The problem was that MZ80 seems to read the memory directly, rather
          than calling my functions. I'll have to rewrite the banking code.
          Rewrote banking code.
11/5/01 - Got screen to work!
          Realtime screen draw. Interrupts implemented. Random keypresses come
          from the keyboard!
          PSG emulation implemented (for keyboard read). Keyboard emulated!
13/5/01 - Added non-alphanumeric keys. Used newer version of MZ80 (faster).
          Added and fixed scrolling.
14/5/01 - Added some missing keys, like the comma. Added primitive loading
          from AMSDOS files (you have to hit F11, then restore, then run).
15/5/01 - Added modes 0+2. Speeded up video code.
16/5/01 - Made the primitive loading a bit more user-friendly.
