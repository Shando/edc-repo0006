09/04/04 - Added RAM banking - works with Robocop, Ecole Buissonaire, and Auf
           Weidersein Monty.
           Fixed colour palette.
           Improved sound, chords now not so much out of frequency.
           Doubled noise frequency.
           Improved timing, Robocop samples now more or less correct frequency.
13/05/04 - Fixed 8255 bug, Starglider now works.
           Tweaked vsync timing a bit, raster splits better in at least
           Robocop, Starglider and Auf Weidersein Monty.
           Bad files on some discs are due to reordering in AMSDOS being
           broken.
15/05/04 - Played about with interrupt timing - Wizball now okay, along with
           Gauntlet and some others.
16/05/04 - Fixed bad catalog on some discs - was actually me overlooking some
           stuff in the DSK loader.
           Fixed bug in RAM banking - Voyage 93 gets further.
           Played with the CRTC a bit - rupture in Voyage 93 now more or less
           works.
20/05/04 - Early envelope emulation. Not quite right yet.
29/05/04 - Altered FDC read code a little, Divine Megademo now loads again.
31/05/04 - Tweaked CRTC code a bit. Prehistorik 2 started working today, but
           is glitchy on first entering game - after vertical scrolling it is
           stable, but in the wrong place.
06/07/04 - Tweaked noise - sounds better.
           Fixed new bug that crashed both Prehistorik 2 and Super Cauldron on
           starting - now they merely glitch.
07/07/04 - Fixed a couple of sound bugs.
