NEW in version 5.2:

- New sound emulation engine with support for Soundblaster (compatible),
  Gravis Ultrasound, and Ensoniq Soundscape. 44kHz and stereo options.
  Accurate recreation of tone frequencies and hardware envelopes. Optimized
  for speed.
  Unfortunately, the new GUS code is currently non-functional; it will be
  fixed for a future version (if possible).
- New FDC code, now 99% complete. All uPD765A commands, except Write ID,
  are faithfully emulated. Most copy protected material can be processed
  without problems.
- Added support for high capacity disk images (eg. 80 tracks, double sided).
  Usually requires the use of an expansion ROM such as VDOS or ROMDOS.
- Scroll-Lock LED indicates any CPC disk activity.
- New auto-calibrating joystick routines and support for two PC joysticks.
- New, faster VESA graphics mode routines.
- Optimized keyboard interrupt handler.
- Completely redesigned user interface. An easy to use file selector is now
  available to select snapshots and disk images. Files can be retrieved from
  different drives, and from within ZIP archives. See the main
  documentation for more details.
- Fixed the snapshot support and maximized their processing speed.
- Removed the "thin grey border" that was visible on some graphics cards in
  800x600 VESA graphics mode.
- Rewrote the CPESETUP utility to be more user-friendly.
- Added spanish translation by Gerardo Brise¤o
