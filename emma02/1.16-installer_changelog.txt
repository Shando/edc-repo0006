· CDP1861, 1870 and TMS 9918 didn’t clear full screen on start-up
· Update of ‘Leds’ (led and Til timing) is now possible to change during run time

· Corrected printer output toolbar (combo and text boxes were not visible)

For example when specifying RAM address 0000-0FFF, memory locations 0000-0FFF will be repeated at 1000, 2000 etc. Note RAM ‘loading’ via the ‘RAM’ fields will only work if RAM is specified at that part of CPU memory.
