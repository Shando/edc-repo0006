· Added instruction trace function (replacing INP/OUT trace functions) 
· Changed X and P to show 4 bit only 
· Added functionality to allow specification of ‘X’ for I/O, 8, 16 bit and register values for instruction trace and breakpoints. For example LDI x specified as an Instr. Trap will break on all LDI commands.

Comx 
· Fixed bug in 80 Column emulation (bug introduced in V1.15)
