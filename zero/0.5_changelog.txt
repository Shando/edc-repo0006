Ver 0.5 Final
---------------
(Consolidated changelist)
+ Zero can be made to automatically restore the last session on startup by turning on the feature via Options. 
+ On screen indicators, like tape and disk activity, can be turned off via Options.
+ Key2Joy feature added that lets the cursor keys be used as a joystick. ALT is fire.
+ Joystick support added. Button mapping is pending.
+ 128K and +3 emulation now pass the fusetest, FWIW.
+ Added support for ZX Spectrum +3 and disk emulation (thanks to Woody for providing the fdc765.dll).
+ Added support for Pentagon 128K and TR DOS (again thanks to Woody for providing the wd1793.dll).
+ Added support for RZX playback.
+ Cheat Helper, File Finder and Tape Browser have all been moved to a new menu that comes up when the Toolbox icon is pressed.
+ Tape Browser now comes up only if its explicitly called up by the user from the above menu.
+ Icons tweaked to reflect the change in user interface.
+ Tape Browser settings are now saved between sessions.
+ Disks drives are accessible throught the right-click context menu. 2 drives are supported for the +3 and 4 drives for the Pentagon.
+ Added support for external tapes and disks as specified in szx file format.
+ Disk drive activity icon and files download complete icons now appear in main window when required.
+ Emulation speed control added in Options. 
+ Added support for forced 4:3 aspect ratio in full screen.
+ Added ULA Plus and +3 disk support when loading from SZX.
+ Monitor now supports Go To address. Clicking on the register values on the right panel also causes a GO TO that address.(CCowley, Obo and others)
+ Monitor can now set breakpoints for specific values read/write from memory, ports etc. 
+ Monitor can step over LDIR, INIR and other block commands (Obo)
+ Added more options to window sizes in the Options window.
+ Added support for loading and saving .scr files.
+ Added an "Auto Load" option in the tape deck, which replaces the near useless "Auto Rewind" option.
* Zero's settings are no more stored in a config file in the installation folder. They are now stored in the user profile folders as required by UAC guidelines.
* The default config xml file has been removed, as it was quite redundant. Default settings are applied internally.
* Removed the Soft Reset option and replaced both Hard and Soft reset option with a single Reset option, which is equivalent to a hard reset.
* All external tools for PZX handling have now been replaced by a single dll that is called directly from code.
* Updated TapeDeck GUI.
* Redesigned the breakpoint window in Monitor. Added options to break on interrupt and re-triggered interrupt.
* Made the Pentagon render window more symmetrical.
* 128ke is not the default machine for loading snapshots anymore. User has to enable it in options for that to work. 
* Changes to the sound playback routines. Shouldn't make any difference to end-user. I think.
* Pixel smoothing option added to Direct X rendering. Off by default.
