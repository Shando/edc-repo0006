Changes in version 2.0.0
------------------------

  * removed Plus/4 emulation (moved to a separate plus4emu project)
  * implemented new video mode that resamples the video output to the
    refresh rate of the monitor; enabling this allows smoother display
    update at the expense of higher CPU usage and some latency in the
    video output
  * screenshots can be saved in 8-bit RLE compressed TGA format
  * quick loading of clock frequency and timing configuration presets
    with PageUp/PageDown keys (useful for switching between normal and
    fast Z80 speed)
  * virtual file I/O can be disabled in the machine configuration
  * bug fixes in NICK emulation
  * attempt to fix OpenGL crash that occurs on some machines
  * added some hacks to the audio driver to reduce timing jitter on
    Windows; this still needs improvements
  * various minor bug fixes
