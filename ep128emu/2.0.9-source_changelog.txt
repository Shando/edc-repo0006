Changes in version 2.0.9
------------------------

  * implemented CPC floppy drive controller (uPD765) emulation:
    - it supports standard and extended .DSK image files, as well as
      using a real disk in the PC floppy drive (the latter is not very
      useful in practice, since it is limited to standard PC format DD
      (720K) disks, which are not supported by AMSDOS)
    - 4 drives can be emulated (although AMSDOS will only use 2)
    - there is (not perfect) emulation of the timing of disk rotation,
      stepping, head (un)load, and data transfers; however, this may
      not work if the image file includes a track format that is not
      possible on a real DD disk (~6250 bytes per track)
    - the FORMAT TRACK (0x0D) command is unimplemented - it will always
      report a write protect error
    - the floppy drive emulation has not been tested extensively yet,
      so there may be problems with unusual disk formats, rarely used
      FDC commands and parameters, and some copy protections
    - reading the I/O ports 80H-9FH in the debugger will return some
      debugging information about the FDC emulation (see the README file
      for details)
    - changes to the installer/packaging: new machine configuration
      files have been added that include AMSDOS (the default is now
      CPC 6128 with AMSDOS), the disk.zip package includes an empty CPC
      disk image, and on Windows .DSK files can be associated with the
      emulator
  * the CPC video emulation now supports half-character resolution
    scrolling by changing the horizontal sync width
  * improved 6845 CRTC emulation accuracy, fixing problems in some CPC
    games
  * it is possible to disable software control of the tape motor (this
    is useful mainly to work around some buggy Enterprise software)
  * when using the PC floppy drive and a real disk for WD177x emulation,
    the geometry parameters are now also queried from the system on
    Linux
  * if the WD177x emulation detects a valid FAT header at the beginning
    of a disk or image, it checks the geometry stored there, and if it
    does not match the emulated hardware geometry, an error is reported;
    this can be disabled by specifying all three parameters manually
  * the Windows installer uses new download locations for the ROM
    package, since the previous ones no longer work
  * the ROM package has been updated (new versions of Enterprise ROMs)
  * minor fixes/improvements in DAVE and NICK emulation
  * on the first page of the debugger window, the memory dump can now
    also display I/O ports
  * the debug display of I/O registers has been changed slightly for CPC
    (shows the currently selected CRTC register, and the CRTC memory
    address)
  * the monitor emulation allows less difference from the standard
    vertical refresh rate than in the previous versions
  * a 189 MB (12x15.75 MB FAT12 partitions) .VHD file has been added to
    the disk image packages
  * the Windows installer now includes LuaJIT 2.0.0 beta5 in addition to
    the stable 1.1.6 version. To use the faster beta version, copy or
    rename lua51-2.dll to lua51.dll, removing or renaming the original
    lua51.dll file
  * some optimizations in Enterprise and CPC emulation
