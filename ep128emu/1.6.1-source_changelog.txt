Changes in version 1.6.1
------------------------

 * ep128emu home page has been moved to
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/ep128emu/
 * Video and sound driver can be selected with the 'video_driver' and
   'sound_driver' configuration options. The available video drivers are
   'null' (no video and keyboard - not very useful), 'sdl', and 'opengl'.
   Sound drivers are 'null' (disable sound), 'sdl', 'alsa' (Linux only),
   and 'winmm' (Win32 only, does not work very well yet).
 * New, OpenGL based video driver that can be enabled with the
   'video_driver=opengl' option. Allows scaling the emulator window by
   any ratio (e.g. from 720x540 to 1024x768), optionally with linear
   filtering, and is faster than the old SDL driver if a high resolution
   is used. Double buffering and 'blit_on_change_only' are supported,
   however, there is no implementation for interlaced display and half
   refresh rate. 'video_hw' is ignored in GL mode, as it always uses
   hardware acceleration. See the file '.ep128rc.gl' for more details.
 * If the OpenGL video module is used, a transparent console overlay may
   be enabled (with the 'gl_console=1' option). This is most useful in
   fullscreen mode where the console messages could not be seen
   otherwise. Messages are shown when the keyboard is in program control
   mode (F12), and are hidden in normal emulation mode.
   The disadvantage of enabling the console is increased CPU usage, and
   it also automatically turns on double buffering and disables
   'blit_on_change_only'. So, the GL console is best used on fast
   computers.
 * Improved color correction: gamma, contrast, and brightness can be
   specified for each color channel (R, G, B), in addition to the overall
   values that affect all channels. For example, the 'gamma_b' option
   sets the gamma correction for the blue channel, 'min_intensity_g'
   controls the minimum intensity (brightness) of the green channel etc.
 * Emulator messages can be logged to a file with the 'logfile=filename'
   option, and it is possible to disable printing to stderr with
   'msg_stderr=0'.
 * Direct floppy access under Windows 2000/XP; set the image name to
   '\\.\A:@80,2,9' or '\\.\B:@80,2,9' for a 3.5" 720k disk (note: the
   disk geometry must be specified, as the emulator cannot detect it).
   5.25" disks were not tested.
 * Bug in disk emulation after snapshot loading may be fixed now.
 * Some functions of the emulator can be accessed with multiple
   keys, for improved compatibility with systems where the original keys
   could not be used for some reason. The new keys are:
     Reset CPU frequency to 4 MHz       Keypad Enter, Keypad *
     HOLD / Quit emulator               Pause, PageUp
     STOP                               Print Screen, End
 * New sound driver for Win32 that uses the waveOut interface, and is
   enabled with 'sound_driver=winmm'. This is experimental, and currently
   not really usable.
 * Added more example configuration files.
