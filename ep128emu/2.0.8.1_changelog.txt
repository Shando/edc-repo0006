Changes in version 2.0.8.1
--------------------------

  * some CPC emulation bugs have been fixed

Changes in version 2.0.8
------------------------

  * implemented ZX Spectrum 48/128 and Amstrad CPC emulation; for now,
    only a basic configuration of these machines is supported (there is
    no disk emulation yet), although the emulation accuracy should be
    good. See the README file for more details
  * new command line options for selecting the machine type to be
    emulated: -ep128, -zx, and -cpc
  * undocumented Z80 flags are emulated more accurately - the only
    instruction that is still not correct is 'BIT n, (HL)'
  * fixed bug in the emulation of DAVE port B6H, which prevented some
    games from working
  * reduced the time before the floppy write buffer is flushed from 4
    seconds to 1 second
  * the editor buffer in the monitor has been increased from 120 to 160
    lines
  * the monitor TR (trace) command has a new optional parameter now that
    controls the printing of additional information about the video
    position and Z80 registers
  * new Lua functions: readWord(), readWordRaw(), writeWord(),
    writeWordRaw(), getIFF1(), getIFF2(), setIFF1(), setIFF2(),
    getVideoPosition(), and getRawAddress(); these are documented in the
    README file
  * detailed information about Lua errors is now also printed if the
    error occurs in an extension function implemented by the emulator
  * segment:offset style breakpoints allow the offset to be greater than
    3FFFH (the two most significant bits are ignored, but must match
    when specifying an address range)
  * the Z80 disassembler in the debugger now supports more undocumented
    instructions
  * fixed bug in the Lua example script
  * the file I/O extension ROM (epfileio.rom) has been modified so that
    EXOS block read and write (6 and 8) calls are implemented in Z80
    code, and not in the emulator; this reduces the speed of these
    operations to a level similar to disk drives, and allows watchpoints
    set on the read or written memory area to work
  * the source code of epfileio.rom is included
