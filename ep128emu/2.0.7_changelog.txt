Changes in version 2.0.7
------------------------

  * implemented IDE hard disk emulation, with support for up to 4 2 GB
    image files in raw or VHD format; a 126 MB disk image with 4 FAT12
    formatted 31.5 MB partitions is also included for use with the
    emulator
  * more accurate Z80, video memory, and NICK I/O port timing; note that
    this change breaks demo compatibility with previous versions
  * improved NICK emulation: all possible video modes, including
    undocumented and "invalid" ones, are now emulated, and some bugs
    have been fixed as well
  * a 4-channel 8-bit external DAC is emulated at ports F0h to F3h
  * new TV emulation mode when using OpenGL video output; it is
    activated by setting the 'quality' parameter to 4, and requires
    OpenGL 2.0 or later with shader support. This mode emulates S-video
    output on a PAL display (Y/C filtering, delay line, and phase
    error), but the quality is also improved by using 32-bit textures
    instead of 16-bit
  * it is now possible to load and use epmemcfg format memory
    configuration files, which allow for avoiding the limitations of the
    GUI based memory configuration; the file format is documented in
    README
  * DAVE sound emulation fixes
  * the 'motor on' bit of WD177x is emulated (the RockDigi demo now
    runs)
  * on Windows, native file selection dialogs are also used in
    tapeedit.exe
  * machine configurations generated by makecfg automatically enable or
    disable the 'virtual file I/O' setting, depending on whether
    epfileio.rom is included
  * the debugger prints more detailed information about syntax and
    runtime errors in Lua scripts, and there is a new button to insert
    an empty breakpoint callback function
  * fixed interlace in single buffered OpenGL mode at quality=0
  * fixed compile error on Linux when building without SDL, or using old
    SCons or Lua versions
  * some other minor bug fixes, and optimizations
