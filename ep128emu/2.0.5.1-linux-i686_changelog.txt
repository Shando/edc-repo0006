Changes in version 2.0.5.1
--------------------------

  * fixed I/O port reading in the debugger
  * minor hardware emulation accuracy improvements

Changes in version 2.0.5
------------------------

  * changed the debugger window layout so that there is a larger window
    with only two tabs; also more information is displayed, and the
    mouse wheel can be used for scrolling the disassembly and memory
    dump views
  * implemented Lua scripting in the debugger; this makes it possible to
    write complex rules for breakpoints, but can have other uses as
    well, since the script can read and write memory, I/O ports, and CPU
    registers, in addition to having access to the standard Lua library
    functions
  * added a simple monitor to the debugger; the supported commands
    include assemble, disassemble, trace, memory and I/O port dump and
    modify, printing and changing CPU registers, memory compare, copy,
    fill, search, load and save, and more (use ? to print the list of
    available commands, or ? N for help on command N)
  * improved the audio quality of AVI recording, at the expense of
    making it somewhat slower
  * added new command line option for selecting the GUI style and colors
  * a few minor bug fixes and improvements
